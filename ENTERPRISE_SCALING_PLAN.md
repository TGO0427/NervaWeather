- Pagination (load 100 containers at a time)
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Background processing for bulk operations

### 3. **API Infrastructure**
**Current**: Direct browser API calls
**Enterprise**:
- Backend API layer with rate limiting
- Queue system for bulk operations
- Webhook endpoints for carrier integrations
- Load balancing for high traffic

### 4. **Real-time Updates**
**Current**: Manual refresh
**Enterprise**:
- WebSocket connections for live updates
- Server-sent events for status changes
- Real-time weather monitoring across all containers
- Live fleet map with 50K+ container positions

## ðŸ“Š Enterprise Features Required

### **Advanced Filtering & Search**
- **Text search**: Find containers by ID, commodity, route
- **Advanced filters**: Date ranges, carrier, status, weather risk
- **Saved searches**: Custom views for different teams
- **Bulk selection**: Select by criteria (all delayed, all high-risk, etc.)

### **Performance Dashboard**
- **Container overview**: 50,000 total, 15,000 in-transit, 234 alerts
- **Performance metrics**: On-time %, delay patterns, cost savings
- **Carrier scorecards**: Performance by shipping line
- **Route analytics**: Best/worst performing routes

### **Enterprise Integrations**
- **ERP Integration**: SAP, Oracle, NetSuite
- **Carrier APIs**: Real-time data from Maersk, MSC, etc.
- **Port Systems**: Terminal operating systems
- **Custom APIs**: Client's internal systems

## ðŸš€ Implementation Timeline
